1) Zero Production:
We cannot generate any strings

2) At most one productions:
Strings with one productions: {wcd<S>, b<L>e, s}

At most one = one productions (union) zero productions.
at most one = {wcd<S>, b<L>e, s}

Set of terminal strings with atmost one productions: {s}

3) At most two productions
Strings with two productions: {wcdwcd<S>, wcdb<L>e, wcds, b<L>;<S>e, b<S>e}

At most two : two productions (union) at most one productions.
At most two: {wcdwcd<S>, wcdb<L>e, wcds, b<L>;<S>e, b<S>e, wcd<S>, b<L>e, s}

Set of terminal strings with atmost two productions: {wcds, s}

4) At most three productions
Strings with three productions: {wcdwcdwcd<S>, wcdwcdb<L>e, wcdwcds, wcdb<L>;<S>e, wcdb<S>e, b<L>;<S><S>e, b<S><S>e, b<L>wcd<S>e, b<L>b<L>ee, b<L>se, bwcd<S>e, bb<L>ee, bse}

At most three : at most two productions (union) three productions.
at most three: {wcdwcdwcd<S>, wcdwcdb<L>e, wcdwcds, wcdb<L>;<S>e, wcdb<S>e, b<L>;<S><S>e, b<S><S>e, b<L>wcd<S>e, b<L>b<L>ee, b<L>se, bwcd<S>e, bb<L>ee, bse, wcdwcd<S>, wcdb<L>e, wcds, b<L>;<S>e, b<S>e, wcd<S>, b<L>e, s}

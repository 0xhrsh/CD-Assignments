1) Zero Production:
We cannot generate any strings

2) At most one productions:
With at most one production, we can generate {wcd<S>, b<L>e, s}. Only 1 out of these consist of terminal symbols, therefore the set of terminal strings we can generate using atmost one production is {s}

3) At most two productions
Strings with two productions: {wcdwcd<S>, wcdb<L>e, wcds, b<L>;<S>e, b<S>e}
Strings with one productions: {wcd<S>, b<L>e, s} (from above)
At most two : two productions (union) one productions (union) zero productions.
At most two: {wcdwcd<S>, wcdb<L>e, wcds, b<L>;<S>e, b<S>e, wcd<S>, b<L>e, s}
Set of terminal strings with atmost two productions: {wcds, s}

4) At most three productions
Strings with three productions: {wcdwcdwcd<S>, wcdwcdb<L>e, wcdwcds, wcdb<L>;<S>e, wcdb<S>e, bwcd<S>e, bb<L>ee, bse, b<L>;<S><S>e, b<S><S>e, b<L>wcd<S>e, b<L>b<L>ee, b<L>se}

Set of terminal strings with atmost three productions: {wcdwcds, bse, wcds, s}

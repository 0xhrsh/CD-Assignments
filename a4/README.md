# Assignment 4

## Input Format
- Enter the number of non terminal symbols (say n).
- For each of the next n lines, enter the ith non terminal symbol (string)
- The program will then ask you to enter the RHS of the CGF for the given LHS. (make sure symbols and '|' are seperated from each other with spaces).


### Example:
You can find the input of Grammar 1 in the file in1.txt and that of Grammar 2 in the file in2.txt. You can email [anand.2@iitj.ac.in](mailto:anand.2@iitj.ac.in) in case of any queries.

You can also find the output when the program is run on grammar 1 or 2 in the file out1.txt or out2.txt respectively.


## Running the program for Grammar 1
```gcc main.c && ./a.out < in1.txt > out1.txt```

## Running the program for Grammar 2
```gcc main.c && ./a.out < in2.txt > out2.txt```

## Copiling and running the program:
```gcc main.c && ./a.out```

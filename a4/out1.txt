Enter the number of non-terminal symbols: Enter 1th non-terminal symbol (string): Enter 2th non-terminal symbol (string): Enter 3th non-terminal symbol (string): Enter 4th non-terminal symbol (string): 
Please enter the RHS like CFG.
For A -> d a | B C, you should enter: "d a | B C" only.
See in1.txt and in2.txt for input for Grammar 1 and Grammar 2

Enter RHS of the CGF for the following NT Symbols (everything should be space separated): 
S -> A -> B -> C -> All Input done!

First(S) =  ?, b, a, d, g, h, 
First(A) =  ?, d, g, h, 
First(B) =  ?, g,
